<h1>SSM Heath Cardinal Glennon Congenital Syphilis Management Guidelines</h1>

<strong>Disclaimer: </strong> This website is designed to be a tool to help clinicians understand congenital syphilis diagnosis and management. The algorithm will populate specific recommendations and rationale based on the answers to the below questions. These guidelines are not intended to replace clinical decision making, the AAP Red Book, and/or Infectious Disease consultation. <br><br><br>


<form id="guidelinesForm">
    <label id="question1" for="history">1. Does the birthing mother have a history of syphilis?</label><br><br>
    <input type="radio" name="history" value="yes"> Yes<br>
    <input type="radio" name="history" value="no"> No<br>
    <input type="radio" name="history" value="unknown"> Unknown <br><br><br>

    <label id="question2" for="treatment">2. When was the birthing mother treated for syphilis? If the birthing mother has been treated multiple times, please respond with the <strong>most recent</strong> treatment course. </label><br><br>
    <input type="radio" name="treatment" value="before"> Before she was pregnant with the neonate being evaluated<br>
    <input type="radio" name="treatment" value="during_before"> During her pregnancy with the neonate being evaluated greater than 30 days prior to delivery<br>
    <input type="radio" name="treatment" value="during_after"> During her pregnancy with the neonate being evaluated less than 30 days prior to delivery<br>
    <input type="radio" name="treatment" value="not treated"> She was not treated<br>
    <input type="radio" name="treatment" value="unknown"> Unknown<br><br><br>

    <label id="question3" for="appropriateTreatment">3. Was the birthing mother's syphilis treatment in question #2 appropriate for her stage of disease? </label><br><br>
    <label id="note3"> IM benzathine penicillin G once per week for 3 weeks in a row is appropriate treatment for almost all of the maternal syphilis that we see in our patient population (exception: tertiary syphilis, neurosyphilis). If more than 9 days elapsed between IM doses, the entire series should have been repeated. Consider this inadequate treatment if the series was <strong>not</strong> repeated. <br>
    A single dose of IM benzathine penicillin G may have been appropriate in a mother who had symptoms at the time of diagnosis. <br>
    Please contact the SSM ID Division if you have further questions about this. Selecting 'unknown' will default the most conservative course, which may not be appropriate depending on the patient's scenario.</label><br><br>

    <input type="radio" name="appropriateTreatment" value="yes"> Yes <br>
    <input type="radio" name="appropriateTreatment" value="no"> No <br>
    <input type="radio" name="appropriateTreatment" value="unknown"> Unknown <br>
    <input type="radio" name="appropriateTreatment" value="NA"> Not Applicable <br> <br><br>
    

    <label id="question4" for="highRisk">4. Has the birthing mother and/or her partner(s) had any high-risk sexual activity or symptoms to suggest a newly acquired infection? </label><br><br>
    <label id="note4"> See the 'Congenital Syphilis Cheat Sheet for SSM Clinicians' Step #1 (Reviewing Mother's History) for a list of appropriate questions to ask the birthing mother in order to discern whether syphilitic risk factors are present. Clicking 'unknown' to this question should be an uncommon occurence (i.e. mother who declines to answer, is not available etc) <br>

    <input type="radio" name="cmiaResult" value="reactive"> CMIA reactive <br>
    <input type="radio" name="cmiaResult" value="not available"> CMIA results unknown (mom's medical records are not available or testing was not obtained during pregnancy) <br><br><br>

    <label id="question6" for="rprTiter">6. What was the birthing mother's RPR titer during pregnancy? If the RPR titer was only checked once during pregnancy, select an option that includes "throughout pregnancy." If the RPR titer was checked twice/multiple times, select an option that pertains to how the RPR result changed/did not change over time. </label><br><br>
    <input type="radio" name="rprTiter" value="non-reactive"> RPR non-reactive throughout pregnancy  <br>
    <input type="radio" name="rprTiter" value="low level positive"> RPR low level positive (1:1, 1:2, 1:4) throughout pregnancy<br>
    <input type="radio" name="rprTiter" value="reactive"> RPR reactive at 1:8 or higher throughout pregnancy<br>
    <input type="radio" name="rprTiter" value="initially reactive"> RPR initially reactive during pregnancy but non-reactive prior to delivery<br>
    <input type="radio" name="rprTiter" value="initially non-reactive"> RPR initially non-reactive during pregnancy but reactive prior to delivery<br>
    <input type="radio" name="rprTiter" value="unknown"> RPR unknown (mom's medical records are not available or testing was not obtained during pregnancy) <br> <br><br>

    <label id="question7" for="tp_pa">7. What was the birthing mother's <strong>most recent</strong> TP-PA result during pregnancy? </label><br><br>
    <label id="note7">In mothers for which there are discordant results (CMIA reactive, RPR non-reactive), a confirmatory treponemal test on the mother called the TP-PA is sent <strong>automatically </strong> to an outside lab with a 3-5 day turnaround time.

    <input type="radio" name="tp_pa" value="reactive"> The TP-PA was reactive <br>
    <input type="radio" name="tp_pa" value="non-reactive"> The TP-PA was non-reactive <br>
    <input type="radio" name="tp_pa" value="NA"> The mother did not have discordant results (e.g. the mother's CMIA and RPR are both reactive) so a TP-PA was not sent. This question is not applicable. <br>
    <input type="radio" name="tp_pa" value="unknown"> I do not know if there were discordant results. I do not have access to the mother's medical records or CMIA/RPR testing was not obtained during pregnancy <br><br><br>
     
    <label id="question8" for="physicalExam">8. Does the neonate's physical exam show any evidence of congenital syphilis? </label><br><br>
    <label id="note8">Physical exam findings associated with congenital syphilis are mentioned in Question #10 of the "Congenital Syphilis Cheat Sheet for SSM Clinicians." Physical exam findings of congenital syphilis are rare in neonates; clicking yes to this question should be an uncommon occurence.  <br>
