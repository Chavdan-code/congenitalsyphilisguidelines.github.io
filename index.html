<h1>SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Congenital Syphilis Management Guidelines</h1>

<strong>Purpose of this website:</strong> This website is intended to function as a clinical support tool for clinicians who care for neonates where there is concern for congenital syphilis.  The goal is to provide management recommendations based on the clinical information obtained from the birthing parent and neonate.  Based on how the clinician answers the below questions, the algorithm will populate specific recommendations regarding further diagnostic testing, treatment and follow up.  A rationale for these recommendations will also be provided.  The goal of this clinical support tool is to provide recommendations on a wide range of inputted scenarios, including those that may not be fully addressed in the AAP Red Book. <br><br>

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This website utilizes the reverse screening algorithm to provide recommendations and rationale regarding congenital syphilis management to help clinicians understand next steps when caring for a neonate at risk of congenital syphilis. These guidelines are not intended to replace clinical decision making, the AAP Red Book, and/or Infectious Diseases consultation. <br><br>

            •If the syphilitic stage is <strong>not</strong> mentioned in the medical record:<br>
            - IM benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin LA) once per week for 3 weeks in a row is sufficient treatment for essentially all stages of syphilis that we see in our birthing parent population. If more than 9 days elapsed between IM doses, the entire series should have been repeated. Consider this inadequate treatment if the series was not repeated.<br><br>
            
            • If the syphilitic stage <strong>is</strong> mentioned in the medical record <strong>or</strong> is clear based on the birthing parent's symptoms at the time: <br>
            - IM benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin LA) once per week for 3 weeks in a row is <strong>necessary</strong> for appropriate treatment of late latent syphilis and latent syphilis of unknown duration <br>
            - A single dose of IM benzathine penicillin G is sufficient treatment for primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis <br><br>
            
            •If the birthing parent was treated with a non-penicillin antibiotic <strong>during their pregnancy</strong>, this should be considered inadequate treatment. <br>
            •If the birthing parent was treated with an appropriate non-penicillin antibiotic (doxycycline, ceftriaxone) <strong>prior to pregnancy</strong>, this should be considered sufficient treatment provided that the full prescribed medication course was completed.<br><br>
            •Please contact the SSM Infectious Disease Division if you have further questions about this. Selecting 'unknown' will default to the most conservative course, which may not be appropriate depending on the patient's scenario. </div><br><br>

    • The birthing parent's history and syphilis testing results indicate that they have a known history of syphilis which was adequately treated prior to the current pregnancy. Given their known history of syphilis, we would expect them to have persistently reactive treponemal antibody levels for life, regardless of which methodology (e.g. CMIA, EIA, TP-PA) is used to detect these antibodies. Thus, the parental TP-PA result should not change management in this circumstance. In the unlikely event that their CMIA is positive and TP-PA is negative, we would still consider the birthing parent 'treponemal antibody positive.' <br> <br>

    • We recommend checking the neonate's RPR as a precaution in case the birthing parent reacquired syphilis  during pregnancy but sufficient time has not passed for their RPR to become reactive. This is less likely for this scenario as the birthing parent reports no high risk sexual activity or symptoms of syphilis. <br>

    • Note: approximately 25% of adults with sexually acquired syphilis are serofast, which means that their RPR titers remain low level positive for years to life after successful treatment (see question #2 in the 'Congenital Syphilis Cheat Sheet for SSM Clinicians' for more details). <br> <br>

    • Although the birthing parent's RPR titer at 1:1/1:2 after appropriate treatment likely represents a serofast state, there is still a possibility that the birthing parent has inadequately treated syphilis or has reacquired syphilis. Therefore, we should still check the neonate's RPR. <br>

An increased RPR at that point supports congenital syphilis in the neonate and would require full evaluation and treatment. </li><br>

        <li> If the neonate's RPR is 4 fold greater than the birthing parent's RPR, the birthing parent likely had inadequately treated syphilis or reacquired syphilis prior to delivery, both of which significantly increase the likelihood of congenital syphilis in the neonate.
