<h1>SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Congenital Syphilis Management Guidelines</h1>

<strong>Disclaimer: </strong> This website is designed to be a tool to help clinicians understand congenital syphilis diagnosis and management. The algorithm will populate specific recommendations and rationale based on the answers to the below questions. These guidelines are not intended to replace clinical decision making, the AAP Red Book, and/or Infectious Disease consultation. <br><br><br>

<form id="guidelinesForm">
    <label id="question1" for="history">1. Has the birthing parent had a known diagnosis of syphilis (either currently or in the past)? </label><br><br>

    <div id="question2" style="display:none;">
        <label for="treatment">2. When was the birthing parent treated for syphilis? If the birthing parent has been treated multiple times, please respond with the <strong>most recent</strong> treatment course. </label><br><br>

        <label for="appropriateTreatment">3. Was the birthing parent's syphilis treatment in question #2 appropriate for their stage of disease? </label><br><br>
        <label id="note3">IM benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin LA) once per week for 3 weeks in a row is appropriate treatment for late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration. This is the most common scenario that we see in our patient population. If more than 9 days elapsed between IM doses, the entire series should have been repeated. Consider this inadequate treatment if the series was not repeated.<br><br>
            If the birthing parent's provider <strong>documented</strong> that they had primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, a single dose of IM benzathine penicillin G should be considered adequate treatment. <br><br>
            If the birthing parent was treated with a non-penicillin antibiotic <strong>during their pregnancy</strong>, this should be considered inadequate treatment. If the birthing parent was treated with an appropriate non-penicillin antibiotic (doxycycline, ceftriaxone) <strong>prior to pregnancy</strong>, this should be considered sufficient treatment provided that the full prescribed medication course was completed.<br><br>
            Please contact the SSM Infectious Disease Division if you have further questions about this. Selecting 'unknown' will default to the most conservative course, which may not be appropriate depending on the patient's scenario. </label><br><br>

    • The birthing parent's history and syphilis testing results indicate that they have a known history of syphilis which was adequately treated prior to the current pregnancy. Given their known history of syphilis, we would expect them to have persistently reactive treponemal antibody levels for life, regardless of which methodology (e.g. CMIA, EIA, TP-PA) is used to detect these antibodies. Thus, the parental TP-PA result should not change management in this circumstance. In the unlikely event that their CMIA is positive and TP-PA is negative, we would still consider the birthing parent 'treponemal antibody positive.' <br> <br>

    • We recommend checking the neonate's RPR as a precaution in case the birthing parent reacquired syphilis  during pregnancy but sufficient time has not passed for their RPR to become reactive.

    • Note: approximately 25% of adults with sexually acquired syphilis are serofast, which means that their RPR titers remain low level positive for years to life after successful treatment (see question #2 in the 'Congenital Syphilis Cheat Sheet for SSM Clinicians' for more details). <br> <br>

    • Although the birthing parent's RPR titer at 1:1/1:2 after appropriate treatment likely represents a serofast state, there is still a possibility that the birthing parent has inadequately treated syphilis or has reacquired syphilis. Therefore, we should still check the neonate's RPR. <br> 

    <ul>
        <li> If the neonate's RPR is non-reactive or low level positive, it is unlikely that the birthing parent was inadequately treated or reacquired syphilis. To rule out that possibility, we recommend that the neonate follows up in the ID clinic in 3 months for a repeat RPR. An increased RPR at that point supports congenital syphilis in the neonate and would require full evaluation and treatment. </li><br>

        <li> If the neonate's RPR is 4 fold greater than the birthing parent's RPR, the birthing parent likely had inadequately treated syphilis or reacquired syphilis prior to delivery, both of which significantly increase the likelihood of congenital syphilis in the neonate. In this scenario, the neoante would require 10 days of penicillin treatment for coverage of congenital syphilis and neurosyphilis. The neonate would fall into the category 'proven or highly probable congenital syphilis' and thus may require additional diagnostic testing per the AAP Red Book and questions #13-15 in the 'Congenital Syphilis Cheat Sheet for SSM Clinicians'  </li>

        • The birthing parent's history and syphilis testing results indicate that they have a known history of syphilis which was adequately treated prior to the current pregnancy. Given their known history of syphilis, we would expect them to have persistently reactive treponemal antibody levels for life, regardless of which methodology (e.g. CMIA, EIA, TP-PA) is used to detect these antibodies. Thus, the parental TP-PA result should not change management in this circumstance. In the unlikely event that their CMIA is positive and TP-PA is negative, we would still consider the birthing parent 'treponemal antibody positive.' <br> <br>

        • We recommend checking the neonate's RPR as a precaution in case the birthing parent reacquired syphilis  during pregnancy but sufficient time has not passed for their RPR to become reactive.
